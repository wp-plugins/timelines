= The plugin offers some help to the user? =

Yes, there is a helper made in Javascript but, for now, it is only available in portuguese (sorry, my poor english was not enough).
 
= There are some limitation? =

Unfortunally, some things allowed by Simile Timelines are not possible in our interface.

* There is only one events source for all tracks
* Decorators are applied to all tracks
* Many other minor things...
